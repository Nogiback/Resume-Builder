# Resume-Builder

[React - CV/Resume Builder Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application#solutions)

The purpose of this project was to build a simple Resume/CV Builder web application using React. Overall, I learned a lot about React components and how to utilize props and states to create the web application. It was interesting switching to a declarative programming style from the imperative programming in vanilla JS.
